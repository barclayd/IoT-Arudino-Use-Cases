    "longDesc": "If you leave the fridge door open, heat is merely recycled from the room into the refrigerator, then back into the room. A net room temperature increase would result from the heat of the motor that would be constantly running to move energy around in a circle. This makes precious, double-blind research drugs at great risk of becoming spoilt and along with other medical equipment, all of which are vitally important for application to patients within hospitals whose lives depend on the application of working drugs and medicines.",

    "arduinoDesc": "The LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit temperature devices with an output voltage linearly-proportional to the Centigrade temperature. The LM35 device has an advantage over linear temperature sensors calibrated in Kelvin, as the user is not required to subtract a large constant voltage from the output to obtain convenient Centigrade scaling. The LM35 device does not require any external calibration or trimming to provide typical accuracies of ±¼°C at room temperature and ±¾°C over a full −55°C to 150°C temperature range.",
