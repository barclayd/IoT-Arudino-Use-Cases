### Definition of Done

Code completed
Code refactored to match existing project, well referenced, commented thoroughly, all TO-DO annotations resolved, checked in and inspected by Peer Review – code review before pull and merge requests (later agreed that this was to be carried out by at least 2 team members). This was decided to prevent merge errors and to help secure working code
Use Gitlab for version control
Feature is documented
Documentation of a feature is to be made in the READ.ME file on Gitlab updated to document changes and explain any feature-specific code
All stories are I.N.V.E.S.T
Tested
Manual unit tests written to test logic and included with in ‘test’ folder in project. Automatic tests optional. All outstanding defects to be resolved. User acceptance testing carried out. Feature works on both web and mobile view platforms

Development made on ‘Development’ branch
Follow and work to Agile principles as closely as possible
A branch per feature
Update the READ.ME file on Gitlab to explain importance and use of feature specific code
Code reviews to be completed by at least two team members before merging code from a development into master branch
If a team-member is late to/missing from the meeting, must inform other members of the team (acceptable to do this via Microsoft Teams)

Testing strategy (unit, functional, integration, performance, stress, etc…)
Expectations of each role and how they will work together at each phase of the SDLC
From Kathryn’s document:

“It is up to your team to determine how you will conduct the next four weeks. But you must come to a joint agreement and then each team member must abide by the agreement. For example, if you agree that you will hold a stand-up every week day, then you must hold a stand up every week day. If you agree that you will only hold stand ups on teaching delivery days, then you must adhere to this. If you do not adhere to the rules you have set yourselves, you are likely to miss out on marks in the self-evaluation part of your portfolio. All teams must have an agreement and all agreements must be sufficiently binding to facilitate work.
The agreement should be approximately a one-page document (with references if necessary) outlining your team’s professional practice and management approach, and each team member must sign it. This must be completed before the first client meeting and it is expected that this will take no longer than two hours to write and agree to. This must be shared amongst the team. You should include it in a file called contributions.md within your source-controlled project”.
