The role of a Trainer is to act as an administrator and a facilitator in this platform. Trainers has privileges to add new use cases, edit users' permissions such as giving them access to new use cases. While the role of Apprentices accounts is to act as learner who wants to learn more about real-life use cases which involves the use of IoT devices.
